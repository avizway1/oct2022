How to enable MFA to root user.??

root user : EMail used to create an AWS account, called root user. Root user have highest permissions/previlages on our aws account. 

Email id and Password..!! --> 

virtual MFA : Microsoft authenticator, Google authenticator, Authy2factor.. 
Hardware MFA : Supported devices..!! 
yuby2key (u2f) key : usb key, Connect this device to the laptop where you want to login 

______

IAM User Vs Root User

IAM : Identity and Access Management : 

Least Privilages Mechanism is suggested and we always follow.

--> Management console access : GUI : Username, Pwd, Sign-In URL : Browser

Permissions : AdministratorACcess
--> Create/choose a Group, Add permissions to group, Add this user to group.
--> Copy permissions from another user.
--> Associate permissions directly to user

Policy : Set of Permissions on our aws account. Policy writtens in JSON format.
--> AWS Managed - Job Function
--> AWS Managed Policy
--> Customer Managed Policy


Add Tags :

https://avinash.s3.amazonaws.com/demo.txt



________________________________

Task : Activate MFA.

Task 1 : Create an IAM User.. Allocate "AdministratorAccess" policy. Login as IAM user and verify his access on "Billing Dashboard". 
*Provide billing access to an IAM user. 

Password policy : 

__________________

Policy : Document contains set of permissions writtens in JSON format. Policy provide permissions on AWS resources for users/groups/roles.

--> AWS Managed Policy : s3 (full, reaonly), ec2 (ec2read, moniroting, full)
--> AWS Managed policy - Job Functions : Network Admin, Database Admin
--> Customer Managed Policy : 

Inline : Not a reusable policy. We can apply policy for specific resource.

Requirement : IAM User required Full Access on AWS services, But not on "S3".

**Deny always have highest privilages. If you all 100 times, but deny 1 times at any level, DENY will take effect. 

S3 and EC2 Full Access As a single policy : 

___________________________________________________________

Credential report : Report related to user cred. 

How to track IAM user activities..?
Ans : CloudTrail. Enbled by defaultly. It stores last 90 days logs.

Policy Simulator : https://policysim.aws.amazon.com/home/index.jsp?#users

Permissions Boundary : Define maximum permissions for an IAM user. 



Policy : Set of permissions on AWS account.
AWS managed - Job Function : Database admin, Network admin, ds, poweruser
AWS managed (based on service): s3 (s3readonly, s3full, s3other services)
Custom Policy : Customer created


AdministratorAccess : Provides full access to AWS services and resources. (root user minus account management)
PowerUserAccess : Provides full access to AWS services and resources, but does not allow management of Users and groups. (administratoraccess minus IAM)
readonlyAccess : Provides read-only access to AWS services and resources.



Task 1: Create an IAM user, provide him "AdministratorAccess", Use same user throughout course.

Task 2 : Try to access billing information with the user created in Task 1. (gives error).. Allow this user to view billing information.

Task 3 : Create an IAM user, Provide "S3FullAccess". Try to activate MFA using same user. GGives an Error. Fix errors.
--> This guy should be able to activate/deactivate mfa himself.

S3 : Simple Storage Service : 
-
Object based storage :  We cannot install/run any applications/os. : Dropbox / GDrive 
--> Designed to flat files.

Block based storage : Designed to run OS, We can install/run applications.. : EBS, Instance store volumes. : EC2 
Storage over the network : Storage runs over the network and it can be mounted to multiple devices. : EFS, FSx : EC2

--> Designed to store objects. We can store any flat files.
--> We store data in BUCKETS. 
--> Bucket names should be unique across the globe. 
--> Defualtly, we can create 100 buckets, This is a soft limit. 
--> We can store unlimited data in a bucket.
--> No Pre-provisioning required.
--> Bucket naming limitations
	--> Min char 3, Max 63 char length
	--> Bucket name should be in small , and numeric
	--> Bucket name should not start with .
	--> Should not end with . , No adjesent ..
	--> Bucket name should not resemble IP address format. (192.168.100.1)

--> We can upload objects to this buckets.
--> Min obj size : 0 bytes.. Max Obj size: 5 TB
--> S3 is a global service. Doesn't required region selection.
--> While creating we need to choose the region. Data physically resides at this regions AZs. 

https://s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/bucketname/objectname (standard URL)
https://bucketname.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/objectname (virtual path)
https://bucketname.s3.amazonaws.com/objectname (virtual path)

Virtual paths won't work if we have . in bucket names.

To make an object public : 

1. Block Public Access settings for this account : Account Level Blocking
2. Block public access (bucket settings) : Bucket level Blocking
--> We should make an object public, then only Object URLs works.
Object Ownership : ACLs enabled
3. Make object public

S3 Free Tier ELigibility : 
5 GB Standard Storage
--> 2000 PUT (Upload) / 20,000 GET (Download)

S3 Storage Classes : 

--> S3 Standard : Defualt storage class for all the data we upload to s3. Data will be available immedeatly.
Designed to store : Frequently accessed data. 
Availability : 99.99%,  Durability: 99.999999999 (11 9's) 
Data replicates across : >= 3 AZs

--> Standard-IA : Data will be available immedeatly. Designed to store : infrequently accessed data
Avai : 99.9%, Durability : 99.999999999 (11 9's) 
Data replicates across : >= 3 AZs

--> One Zone-IA : Data will be available immedeatly. Designed to store : infrequently accessed data. Store only non-critical data
Avai : 99.5 %, Durability : 99.999999999 (11 9's) 
Data replicates across : 1 AZs

--> Glacier Flexible Retrieval (Formerly Glacier) : Long-term data archiving with retrieval times ranging from minutes to hours. Data won't be available immedeatly. We need to initiate a data restration to view the data. Restoration takes (1 min - 5 Hrs)
Avai : 99.99 %, Durability : 99.999999999 (11 9's) 
Data replicates across : >= 3 AZs

--> Glacier Instant Retrieval : Long-lived archive data accessed once a quarter with instant retrieval in milliseconds. 

--> Glacier Deep Archieve : Long-term data archiving with retrieval times ranging from 12 hrs. Data won't be available immedeatly. We need to initiate a data restration to view the data. Restoration takes (5 - 12 Hrs)
Avai : 99.99 %, Durability : 99.999999999 (11 9's) 
Data replicates across : >= 3 AZs
..
S3 Intelligent Tier : If we have unknown access pattern, we can choose. 
Avai : 99.9 %, Durability : 99.999999999 (11 9's) 
Data replicates across : >= 3 AZs

RRS : Redused Redundancy Storage : Not Recommanded : Less durability.. 
Durability : 99.99%, As we have less durability we have high chances to loss the data when compared to another storage classes.


S3 Pricing : 
--> How much data we are storing.
--> How many GET/PUT operations (uploads/downloaded object count)
--> Data retrivals

Glacier data retrival : 
Bulk retrieval : Typically within 5-12 hours.
Standard retrieval : Typically within 3-5 hours.
Expedited retrieval : Typically within 1-5 minutes when retrieving less than 250 MB.

______________________________________________________________________________________

Task : 
--> Enable "Free tier alerts". Login using root user/iam user with admin permissions..
Preferences --> Billing preferences --> Receive Free Tier Usage Alerts --> Enable and enter valid email address.

Task 2 : Create an s3 bucket, Upload an object, Make object public accesable.

________________

Task : Create a policy to allow everything in an AWS account, But user should be able to create a bucket in "ap-south-1" region only.
--> Create a bucket in "mumbai", it should work... But if he try to create bucket in any other region it should fail.
