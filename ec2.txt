source : From where you want to connect to this instance.
MyIP : It picks currently connected network ip address. No one can connect to the server apart from this particular network users.
Custom : We can give any network IPs. 
Anywhere : Anyone with valid credentials can connect to the server. (username and pwd)

Step 7 : Review and launch with keypair.

Keypair : Key pair contains public key and private key. (.pem)

AWS Holds the Public Key. This will be stored in our launched ec2 instances.
Customer/WE holdes the Private key. Used to decrypt/generate the password for initial instance connect.

Public IP : Unique across the globe : Use this to connect to your instance.
Private IP : Unique with in the aws network : 

COnnect to Windows Instance :

--> Open "run" , type "mstsc" , CLick enter.. Provide instance "Public IP".
--> Choose instance "connect', choose "RDP Client", "Download remote desktop file"

EBS : Elastic Bloc Storage : Block based storage : Designed to run OS.. 

root : SSD and magnetic is supported.
Addl volume : SSD, HDD and magnetic

Step 4 : CHoose Storage

--> EBS : Elastic Block Storage
SSD / HDD / Magnetic

General purpose SSD : gp2 / gp3
Provisioned iops SSD : io1 / io2 / io2blockexpress*

Throughput optimized HDD : st1 : 
Cold hdd : sc1 

Magnetic : standard

IOPS : Input and Output Operations per second

root Volume : COntains OS : gp2, gp3, io1, io2 and standard/magnetic
Additional volume : all root supported + st1, sc1

General Purpose SSD : (gp2 / gp3) : Low latency interactive applications, Dev and test environment..!!
Min : 1 GiB, Max: 16 TiB... Max IOPS: 16,000 IOPS
gp2 --> works 1 : 3 ration (1 gb volume = 3 iops), with min of 100..

for gp3, we have an advantage, we can mention/choose required IOPS count.

__

Provisioned iops : (io1 & io2) : workload that requires Specific IOPS count.. or if we need more than 16,000 iops for our ec2 instance.. I/O Intensive database workloads..
Min : 4 GiB, Max: 16 TiB... Max IOPS: 64,000 IOPS
--> It provided highest performance among all. 

io2 Block Express volume : Min : 4 GiB, Max: 64 TiB...
Supports 256,000 IOPS.. 
__

Magnetic : Standard : Less freq accessed data, Low cost storage solutions.. 
Min : 1 GiB, Max: 1 TiB...
__

Throughput optimized HDD : st1 : Bigdata, Data warehousing, log processing.. 
Size : Min 125 GiB - 16 TiB.. IOPS : 500.. Throughput : 500 MB/S..

Cold HDD : sc1 : THroughput orientes storages, but with Less Frequently accessed.. Lower cost than st1.. 
Size : Min 125 GiB - 16 TiB.. IOPS : 250.. Throughput : 250 MB/S..


Free Tier : 30 gb Gp2 and standard storage.. 

--> 20% of volume size (or) 5 gb.. WHichever is highest

** Need to perform OS level operations to make additional volumes available.
--> Disk Management --> diskmgmt.msc --> choose volume --> make it online --> Initilize disk --> SImple volume --> NTFS/FAT --> Create

Windows : FAT, FAT32, NTFS, ReFS
Linux : ext3, ext4, xfs


_______

Windows : FAT, FAT32, NTFS, ReFS
Linux : ext3, ext4, xfs

df	: disk filesystem

/dev/xvdf --> 1 gb volume

grab the name of new volume : /dev/xvdb

lsblk		--> List block based devices
df -Th		--> List the available volumes

/dev/xvda1	--> root volume (/)
/dev/xvdf	--> new Volume name 

In windows OS, we mount new volumes to drive letters.. But in Linux OS, We mount volumes to Directory. 

mkdir newvolume

file -s /dev/xvdf  	--> If this command returns with "data", no file system.
			--> If this returns ext3/xfs filesystem.. We have a file system.


mkfs -t xfs /dev/xvdf		--> Make file system and write it to Additonal volume

mount /dev/xvdf newvolume/	--> mount addl volume to directory

--> Above mount is temp mount only.. it won't available after the instance reboot.
--> To make this volume perm mount to the directory, Add entry in "/etc/fstab" file.
--> Get the entry information from "/etc/mtab" file. 

--> cat /etc/mtab		--> Grab the entry related to newly added addl volume

/dev/xvdb /home/ec2-user/newvolume xfs rw,relatime,attr2,inode64,noquota 0 0

--> vim /etc/fstab.. Write the above entry, save and quit the editor. (Do not edit the existing entry).

mount -all
__________
--> Increase the volume size the "Cosole" first, then execute the below command..!!

We can use "xfsprogs" to increase existing volume size. 

yum install xfsprogs

--> xfs_growfs -d /volume-Mountpoint
--> xfs_growfs -d /home/ec2-user/newvolume

_________

Task : Launch an ec2 instance, Create a 1gb volume, associate it with ec2 instance.. Make 1 gb volume available at os level and write some data into it. (Reboot and verify)

Task 2 ; Increase the size of 1gb volume to 2 gb and verify with df -Th

Task 3 ; Launch another ec2 instance in same AZ as existing ec2 instance.. Detach the volume from instance 1 and attach it to newly launched ec2 instance. You should be able to see all the data.


===========================================================================

--> Increasing volume is possible, But redusing volume is not possible.


To verify File system status from a volume : file -s /dev/xvd*
--> If out put : data : no file system

new volume name : /dev/xvdf

Step 1 : Write File system			mkfs -t xfs /dev/xvdf
Step 2 : Create a folder			mkdir newvolume
Step 3 : Mount volume to folder		mount sourcefolder volumename		mount /dev/xvdf newvolume 


New volume name : /dev/xvdg

step 1 : mkfs -t xfs /dev/xvdg
step 2 : mkdir 2gbvolume
step 3 : mount /dev/xvdg 2gbvolume/

Step 4 : Grab the entry information from /etc/mtab file

/dev/xvdf /home/ec2-user/newvolume xfs rw,relatime,attr2,inode64,logbufs=8,logbsize=32k,noquota 0 0
/dev/xvdg /home/ec2-user/2gbvolume xfs rw,relatime,attr2,inode64,logbufs=8,logbsize=32k,noquota 0 0

Step 5 : Edit the "/etc/fstab" file and write the information grabbed from "/etc/mtab" file.

===================================================================================================================


windows + R ==> type "services.msc" ==. show all the services your windows os is using. (running/stopped)
Startup ==> enabled / disabled


yum install httpd -y
service httpd start/status
chkconfig httpd on

curl http://localhost/

Security group must be open with port 80 (http)

cd /var/www/html/
vim index.html

Windows OS file Systems: 
FAT 32
NTFS ==> most used
ReFS

Linux OS File Systems: 
EXt3
ext4
xfs ==> most used
nfs

df ==> volumes
df -Th

lsblk ==> show all associated volumes
df -Th ==> Shows OS detected volumes (usable volumes)

grab the name : /dev/xvda1

Create a new volume. (volume is in same AZ of our ec2 instance) and attach to instance.
Navigate to instancew and run "lablk" and grab the new volume name.

New volume name : /dev/xvdf

verify new volume has any file system .??? 

file -s /dev/xvdf

If out put is ""/data"", That means we dont have any file system. As a first step write a file system to the new volume.

mkfs -t xfs /dev/xvdf		==> Write xfs file system to new 1 gb volume.

mount /dev/xvdf volume1/	==> Mouting xvdf (1gb) to a directory named volume1

==> Whatever mount we performed, This is temp mount.. It lasts till instance reboot.. 
If you want to make it perm mopunt, add an entry in a file named "/etc/fstab"

==> Grab the entry information from a file "/etc/mtab"

/dev/xvdf /home/ec2-user/volume1 xfs rw,relatime,attr2,inode64,logbufs=8,logbsize=32k,noquota 0 0


Decreasing volume size is not possible. 

First increase the volume size in AWS console. 

At OS level.. xfs_growfs -d /mountpoint (/dev/xvdf)
